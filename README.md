FIS-Wasser-MV
--------------
The information system provides the complete WFD (Water Framework Directive) set of information for the German federal State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. In addtion to the actual water body information this includes statistics, information on farming and environmental protection etc to be used to evaluate the quality status of water bodies.

FGSK Topic application as part of FIS-Wasser
---------------
The hydromorphologic status is an important auxillary parameter to support the WFD induced reporting obligations. The approach is a well known and approved method to determin the water body quality status. The FGSK software supports the creation and maintainance of hydromorphological maps.

GUP-MV
--------
The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) commits the member states to achieve a better qualitative status of Europes water bodies. In the context of the project we have developed a software to plan and monitor WFD compliant Water body management measures.

You can find more information about the background of the system on the following sites:
